                <p>
                    You have been exiled from Oriath, your birthplace. You have just washed ashore Twilight Strand. 
                    You encounter a dying exile beside you. He draws his last breath wishing his head had been cut off 
                    back in Oriath right before he is devoured by an undead creature. You manage to salvage a crude weapon 
                    and finish off the creature before it could attack you. You continue journeying through the monster-
                    infested beach until you finally encounter your first town in Wraeclast -- Lioneye’s Watch.

                    Path of Exile is an online Action RPG (available for Windows and Xbox One) set in the dark fantasy world 
                    of Wraeclast, where nightmarish monsters lunge at you the moment you approach them and bits of Wraeclast’s 
                    mysterious history lie scattered throughout the continent for you to find. Some of the game’s strongest 
                    points is its replayability, the strong currency system, the deep character customization, its competitive 
                    potential, and the various leagues that spices up the gameplay with different mods. So if you’re looking 
                    for a new immersive and addictive game where you’ll get to experiment with a giant pool of awesome skills, 
                    Path of Exile is the way to go.
