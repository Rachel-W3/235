                                "Quick to anger, even quicker to strike, the Duelist is a man of haughty 
                                character and deadly skill. He is brash and confident. Some might call him 
                                arrogant, but he backs up his taunts with a keen blade and a callous heart. 
                                The Duelist is a thrill-seeker, always sniffing out conflict and picking 
                                fights. This habit has gotten him in trouble countless times, but he's always 
                                survived with skill and guile. The Duelist is a master of close-quarters combat, 
                                dealing lethal damage with a wide array of weapons while escaping most harm. 
                                Women swoon at the sight of him, men tremble at the thought of him, and few that 
                                face him in battle live to tell the tale."

                                heavy two-handed axe or mace. He plunges into battle with a cry of delight,

                                has also granted her the time and necessity to master a wide range of weapons. 
                                Despite her prowess on the battlefield, the Ranger is most comfortable hidden 
                                from view, felling her opponents from a distance with her mighty long bow. When

                                "The youngest daughter of a respected family. Dresses, dances, suitors... a 
                                fortunate life for one fortunately born. My life... had I not been different. 
                                Had I not thought more clearly, learned more quickly, dreamed more deeply and 
                                darkly than any child should.
                                There seems to be no limit to what I can do, no walls containing my talents. 
                                To my parents, I was a raw nugget to be battered and moulded into a prize for 
                                admiration, for envy... for sale. That life died on a wedding bed in Theopolis.
                                Today, Wraeclast offers me a new life, written not by birth, nor family, nor 
                                society. This life will be written to answer but one question: Who am I?"
