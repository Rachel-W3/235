                    Hi there! I am a Game Design and Development student and I enjoy bringing things
                    to life with C# and Unity. Before coming to college, I've always had an interest
                    in both art and programming, so I figured what better way to have the best of both
                    worlds than in game design? Some of my favorite games include&nbsp;Divinity: Original Sin 2
                    and Undertale, both of which are strong RPGs with equally strong soundtracks. In the distant
                    future, I intend to make my own game that will hopefully be of equal quality as those two
                    gems, but in the meantime, I aim to master the skills I will need to fulfill those goals.
                </p>
